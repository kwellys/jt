      Logan Coach needed to develop a system that would allow to create orders
      with custom trailer configuration, add customer preferences and provide
      final estimate. After the order is confirmed, information is sent to the
      factory, production status is displayed in the system. Web application
      also allowed to maintain customer database, statistics on produced and
      sold trailers. Apart from that we also had to develop company's web site.

    Designed and developed clients website. Set up back office system so that
    any dealer or employee of Logan coach can easily configure a trailer, issue
    an invoice and send an order to production. After release and
    implementation, we actively finalized the system and are now implementing
    new functionality.
