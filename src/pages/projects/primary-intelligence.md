    In 3 years we managed to completely rebuild the system on Node.js. Updated
    the old version of TruVoice application and released a brand new version
    with modern design, updated and optimized basic functionality and tons of
    new features. Created new, adaptive, intuitive and fast Dashboard, that
    displays basic information and analytics for each interview. Developed
    massive, convenient and fully-customizable reporting system.

    We have built several modules for analysis of the company’s business data
    about customer relations. Added system for viewing and editing information
    about each interview with the client’s basic analytics block. Implemented
    new big module builder with custom interviews, polls, templates and
    different types of QnA. Developed 2 additional products for working with
    questionnaires, poll answers, and online interviews.

    Work was organized according to agile methodology.
