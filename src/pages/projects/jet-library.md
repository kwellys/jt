    JET Library is our own project that allows automating workflow in any
    company. In the application, it is possible to store documents and employees
    personal files and set access to certain documents, depending on employee’s
    access level or workgroup.

    When we started this project our main goal was to make it scalable. Apart
    from that we wanted to achieve maximum response speed, which is important
    when working with large volumes of data. Another important task was to
    design intuitive and minimalistic interface.
