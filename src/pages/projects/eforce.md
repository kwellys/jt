      Develop ePawnShop from scratch. Inventory system should synchronize with
      Police department’s database and check if new pawned items are stolen. If
      there is a match, the responsible manager is notified that the item is
      wanted.

    Initial scope was just a backbone of the project, but in the end, we
    delivered the whole project. Within a year we developed the project from
    scratch, set up integration with the police department's database and item
    verification by serial numbers, characteristics and visual parameters.

    As a result, the system can automatically find matches in police
    department’s database and warn pawnshop staff that the item is stolen.
