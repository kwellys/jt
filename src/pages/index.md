      Jet Technical was able to work with initial designs and subsequently
      mitigate a high volume of design gaps and change requests inside of an
      extremely aggressive timeline. Jet Technical remained very committed to
      stabilizing the product over 3 major releases and remained fair and
      conscientious on the affordability of their services throughout.

      Their support for the entire IT infrastructure has been invaluable over
      the years. Their availability regardless of the time difference,
      reliability, and communication put them in the spotlight. Their
      competitive prices are hard to beat, though they could invest in creating
      their own QA department.
