    Back-end is the core ifrastructure that powers applications and websites. It
    is responsible for how fast content is retrived and stored, and ultimately
    affects speed and reliability of the entire application or service. Poorly
    engeneered back-end can result in slow performance, bad scalability and
    possible denial of service. Back-end is the engine that runs your
    application, it should be perfectly engeneered to ensure performance. This
    is why experience of the back-end developers plays the crucial role.
